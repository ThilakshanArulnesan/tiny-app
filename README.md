# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Users are able to log in, create/modify/update a shortened URL that they can share. TinyApp keeps track of the number of times a shortened link has been used (along with unique users) that is visible to the creator of the shortened url. 

## Final Product

!["Registration"](docs/registration.png)
TinyURL has a registration page that takes an e-mail as the user ID along with a password. Once logged in, a user can access their created links. Login is not required to use the shortened URL links. 

!["Create short URL"](docs/create.png)
Users can create a new tiny URL with a simple click of a button.

!["Visit index page"](docs/indexpage.png)
Once a link has been created, it will be displayed in the users list of URLs (can be accessed throguh ``exampleDomain.com/urls``). From this page users may delete their TinyApp URLs. They may also press the edit button to change the hyperlink of the short URL.

!["Edit previous links"](docs/editpage.png)
A user may edit the link to their shortened URL as well as see statistics for the link usage.
